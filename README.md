# Dashboard for Intraday Performance Tracking

This project was developed in 2022 for a small asset management firm to monitor the **intraday performance** of their funds and track key **operational KPIs** in real time.

## Purpose & Impact

The dashboard was designed with two primary objectives:

1. **Performance Monitoring** – Providing the team with a centralized interface to track fund performance and other critical operational metrics throughout the trading day.
2. **Investor Transparency & Engagement** – Offering a tool to showcase **asset selection rationale** to potential investors, helping them understand the systematic approach behind investment decisions. This transparency played a role in securing additional investments for the firm.

## Technical Overview

- The original implementation integrated with an API built using **FastAPI**, which fetched data from the firm’s **relational database** and external sources.
- The UI was designed to present real-time insights in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

## Disclaimer

The data presented in this demo is entirely fictional. The current version uses faker.js to generate synthetic data for UI population. In the real-world implementation, the dashboard was connected to live financial data sources via the FastAPI backend.
