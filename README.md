# Dashboard for Intraday Performance Tracking

This project was built for a small asset management firm in 2022. The main goal here was to create a dashboard that allowed the team to track the intraday performance of their funds and other operational KPIs.

The other goal was to allow the team to leverage the app to show potential investors how and why which assets were picked for their funds. This enabled the team to convince a few investors that their systematic approach was not a black box and helped bring some additional investments to the firm.

## Disclaimer

The data presented in this dashboard is purely fictional. I'm using faker.js to generate synthetic data and populate the UI. In reality this app was built to interact with an API built using FastAPI, which would read the data needed from the firm's relational database and a few external sources.
